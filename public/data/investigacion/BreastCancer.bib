    abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent malignancy in Latin
                American women, most cases being diagnosed at locally advanced or
                metastatic stages when options for cancer care are limited.
                Despite its label as a public health problem in the region, Latin
                American BC patients face several barriers in accessing standard
                of care treatment when compared with patients from developed
                countries. In this review, we analyse the landscape of the four
                main identified barriers in the region: i) high burden of locally
                advanced/advanced BC; ii) inadequate access to medical resources;
                iii) deficient access to specialised cancer care and iv)
                insufficient BC research in Latin America. Unfortunately, these
                barriers represent the main factors associated with the BC poor
                outcomes seen in the region. Targeted actions should be conducted
                independently by each country and as a region to overcome these
                limitations and create an enhanced model of BC care.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer is the most-commonly diagnosed malignant tumor in
                women in the world, as well as the first cause of death from
                malignant tumors. The incidence of breast cancer is constantly
                increasing in all regions of the world. For this reason, despite
                the progress in its detection and treatment, which translates
                into improved mortality rates, it seems necessary to look for new
                therapeutic methods, and predictive and prognostic factors.
                Treatment strategies vary depending on the molecular subtype.
                Breast cancer treatment is multidisciplinary; it includes
                approaches to locoregional therapy (surgery and radiation
                therapy) and systemic therapy. Systemic therapies include hormone
                therapy for hormone-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2
                therapy for HER2-positive disease, and quite recently,
                immunotherapy. Triple negative breast cancer is responsible for
                more than 15–20\% of all breast cancers. It is of particular
                research interest as it presents a therapeutic challenge, mainly
                due to its low response to treatment and its highly invasive
                nature. Future therapeutic concepts for breast cancer aim to
                individualize therapy and de-escalate and escalate treatment
                based on cancer biology and early response to therapy. The
                article presents a review of the literature on breast carcinoma—a
                disease affecting women in the world.},

    abstract = {Objectives Breast cancer screening guidelines could provide
                valuable tools for clinical decision making by reviewing the
                available evidence and providing recommendations. Little
                information is known about how many countries have issued breast
                cancer screening guidelines and the differences among existing
                guidelines. We systematically reviewed current guidelines and
                summarized corresponding recommendations, to provide references
                for good clinical practice in different countries. Methods
                Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and
                Scopus from inception to March 27th, 2021 were conducted and
                supplemented by reviewing the guideline development
                organizations. The quality of screening guidelines was assessed
                from six domains of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
                Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ)~instrument by two appraisers. The basic
                information and recommendations of the issued guidelines were
                extracted and summarized. Results A total of 23 guidelines issued
                between 2010 and 2021 in 11 countries or regions were identified
                for further review. The content and quality varied across the
                guidelines. The average AGREE Ⅱ scores of the guidelines ranged
                from 33.3\% to 87.5\%. The highest domain score was "clarity of
                presentation" while the domain with the lowest score was "
                applicability". For average-risk women, most of the guidelines
                recommended mammographic screening for those aged 40–74 years,
                specifically, those aged 50–69 years were regarded as the optimal
                age group for screening. Nine of 23 guidelines recommended
                against an upper age limit for breast cancer screening.
                Mammography (MAM) was recommended as the primary screening
                modality for average-risk women by all included guidelines. Most
                guidelines suggested annual or biennial mammographic screening.
                Risk factors of breast cancer identified in the guidelines mainly
                fell within five categories which could be broadly summarized as
                the personal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast
                cancer; the family history of breast cancer; the known genetic
                predisposition of breast cancer; the history of mantle or chest
                radiation therapy; and dense breasts. For women at higher risk,
                there was a consensus among most guidelines that annual MAM or
                annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be given, and the
                screening should begin earlier than the average-risk group.
                Conclusions The majority of 23 included international guidelines
                were issued by developed countries which contained roughly the
                same but not identical recommendations on breast cancer screening
                age, methods, and intervals. Most guidelines recommended annual
                or biennial mammographic screening between 40 and 74 years for
                average-risk populations and annual MAM or annual MRI starting
                from a younger age for high-risk populations. Current guidelines
                varied in quality and increased efforts are needed to improve the
                methodological~quality of guidance documents. Due to lacking
                clinical practice guidelines tailored to different economic
                levels, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should apply and
                implement the evidence-based guidelines with higher AGREE Ⅱ
                scores considering local adaption.},

    abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in women
                worldwide and in Chile. Due to the lack of a Chilean national
                cancer registry, there is partial information on the status of BC
                in the country. We aim to estimate BC incidence and mortality
                rates by health care providers and regions for Chilean women. We
                used two public anonymized databases provided by the Ministry of
                Health: the national death and hospital discharges datasets. We
                considered a cohort of 58,254 and 16,615 BC hospital discharges
                and deaths for the period 2007–2018. New BC cases increased by
                43.6\%, from 3,785 in 2007 to 5,435 in 2018. Total BC deaths
                increased by 33.6\% from 1,158 to 1,547 during the same period.
                Age-adjusted incidence rates were stable over time, with an
                average rate of 44.0 cases/100,000 women (SD 2.2). There were
                considerable differences in age-adjusted incidence rates among
                regions, with no clear geographical trend. Women affiliated to a
                private provider (ISAPRE) have an average age-adjusted incidence
                rate of 60.6 compared to 38.8 (both cases/100,000 women) for
                women affiliated with the public provider (FONASA). Age-adjusted
                mortality rates have an average of 10.5 cases/100,000 women (SD
                0.4). This study shows important differences in incidence rates
                between private and publicly insured women, with no significant
                differences in mortality rates. Such differences may be
                associated with women’s lifestyles, dietary compositions,
                comorbidities, and differences in healthcare systems. These
                hypotheses should be studied in greater depth. Additionally,
                differences in BC incidence found in this study compared to
                incidences reported from other estimations reinforce the need of
                a national cancer registry that should lead to more accurate
                indicators regarding BC in Chile.},

    abstract = {Background: Reducing treatment delay improves outcomes in breast
                cancer. The aim of this study was to determine factors
                influencing patient- and system-related delays in commencing
                breast cancer treatment in different countries. Methods: A total
                of 6588 female breast cancer patients from 12 countries were
                surveyed. Total delay time was determined as the sum of the
                patient-related delay time (time between onset of the first
                symptoms and the first medical visit) and system-related delay
                time (time between the first medical visit and the start of
                therapy). Results: The average patient-related delay time and
                total delay time were 4.7 (range: 3.4–6.2) weeks and 14.4 (range:
                11.5–29.4) weeks, respectively. Longer patient-related delay
                times were associated with distrust and disregard, and shorter
                patient-related delay times were associated with fear of breast
                cancer, practicing self-examination, higher education level,
                being employed, having support from friends and family and living
                in big cities. The average system-related delay time was 11.1
                (range: 8.3–24.7) weeks. Cancer diagnosis made by an oncologist
                versus another physician, higher education level, older age,
                family history of female cancers and having a breast lump as the
                first cancer sign were associated with shorter system-related
                delay times. Longer patient-related delay times and higher levels
                of distrust and disregard were predictors of longer
                system-related delay times. Conclusions: The delay in diagnosis
                and treatment of breast cancer remains a serious problem. Several
                psychological and behavioural patient attributes strongly
                determine both patient-related delay time and system-related
                delay time, but their strength is different in particular

                challenges and consequences associated with the delayed diagnosis
                of BCYW. The consequences of delayed diagnosis in young women -
                which generally varies among developed, developing, or
                underdeveloped countries - are severe due to a faster breast
                tumor growth rate than tumors in older women, also contributing
                to advanced cancer stages and poorer outcomes. Though there are
                many underlying reasons for diagnostic delays due to age, the
                article delves explicitly deep into the diagnostic delay of BCYW,
                focusing on healthcare providers, potential contributing factors,
                its consequences, and the urgent need to start minimizing such
                incidences. The article suggests several strategies to address
                these issues, including increasing awareness, developing
                educational programs for healthcare providers to identify signs
                and symptoms in young women, developing clear diagnostic
                guidelines, and improving screening strategies.},

    abstract = {Timely cancer diagnosis is important, but delays are common,
                also among women. This study reviews recent literature on
                diagnostic delays in women with breast cancer, focusing on
                individual-level factors and their interaction with micro, meso,
                exo, and macrosystem factors. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we
                conducted a scoping review on diagnostic delays in cancer among
                women, including qualitative and quantitative studies with
                oncological patients or healthcare professionals. We searched
                PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus for publications from 2018 to November
                28, 2023, excluding studies not meeting the inclusion criteria,
                not in English or Dutch, or focused solely on cancer screening.
                Titles and full texts were screened, with disagreements resolved
                through discussion. Two reviewers independently extracted study
                details, population characteristics, study design, and factors
                contributing to diagnostic delays. Initially, 9699 records were
                retrieved, resulting in 129 relevant studies after exclusions. We
                focused on women's health and breast cancer, narrowing our scope
                to 22 studies in high-income countries. Studies explored
                diagnostic delays and factors at various levels: microsystem
                (demographics, health behaviours, psychology, healthcare
                interactions), mesosystem (schedules, peer and support networks),
                exosystem (social, cultural, environmental, accessibility
                factors), and macrosystem (broader cultural, societal contexts,
                healthcare policies). In high-income countries, diagnostic delays
                in breast cancer care involve factors across various systems,
                affecting individuals, peers, healthcare, and policies. Enhancing
                awareness, communication, and access is important, requiring
                targeted campaigns and infrastructure upgrades. The
                Bronfenbrenner's ecological model effectively addresses the
                multifaceted factors influencing diagnostic delays. Future
                research can benefit from applying this model to various cancers
                and income settings.},

                to explore perceived inequities in access to effective diagnosis
                and treatment in women with breast cancer according to Tanahashi
                model and social determinants of health model. An exploratory
                case study, under a qualitative paradigm, was conducted.
                Theoretical sampling guided the selection of diverse participant
                profiles, comprising breast cancer patients, healthcare
                professionals and a civil society leader. The strategies for the
                recruitment process included social networks, civil society
                organizations, health professionals, and the snowball technique.
                Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were
                transcribed, anonymized, and coded using ATLAS.Ti for deductive
                thematic analysis. Barriers to effective healthcare access were
                identified in all components of Tanahashi model. Accessibility
                and acceptability were the components with most perceived
                barriers. From the determinants of health model, a woman from the
                public health system, with low income, under 30 or over 40, and
                residing in a different region from the metropolitan region faces
                more barriers to access to an effective healthcare. The main
                barriers were for the high centralisation of healthcare in Chile,
                not integrated health system network, misinformation to the
                patient, and non-humanized healthcare. The results of this study
                offer a comprehensive exploration of perceived barriers to
                effective breast cancer diagnosis and treatment in Chile, using a
                qualitative approach incorporating diverse perspectives. Findings
                underscore significant systemic challenges across Tanahashi’s
                model components, impacting the overall care experience. The
                study reveals structural inequities hindering healthcare access,

                change in mammographic density in each breast over time and risk
                of subsequent breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
                This nested case-control cohort study was sampled from the Joanne
                Knight Breast Health Cohort of 10 481 women free from cancer at
                entry and observed from November 3, 2008, to October 31, 2020,
                with routine screening mammograms every 1 to 2 years, providing a
                measure of breast density. Breast cancer screening was provided
                for a diverse population of women in the St Louis region. A total
                of 289 case patients with pathology-confirmed breast cancer were
                identified, and approximately 2 control participants were sampled
                for each case according to age at entry and year of enrollment,
                yielding 658 controls with a total number of 8710
                craniocaudal-view mammograms for analysis. EXPOSURES Exposures
                included screening mammograms with volumetric percentage of
                density, change in volumetric breast density over time, and
                breast biopsy pathologyconfirmed cancer. Breast cancer risk
                factors were collected via questionnaire at enrollment. MAIN
                OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Longitudinal changes over time in each
                woman’s volumetric breast density by case and control status.
                RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 947 participants was 56.67
                (8.71) years at entry; 141 were Black (14.9\%), 763 were White
                (80.6\%), 20 were of other race or ethnicity (2.1\%), and 23 did
                not report this information (2.4\%). The mean (SD) interval was
                2.0 (1.5) years from last mammogram to date of subsequent breast
                cancer diagnosis (10th percentile, 1.0 year; 90th percentile, 3.9
                years). Breast density decreased over time in both cases and
                controls. However, there was a significantly slower decrease in
                rate of decline in density in the breast that developed breast
                cancer compared with the decline in controls (estimate = 0.027;
                95\% CI, 0.001-0.053; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This
                study found that the rate of change in breast density was
                associated with the risk of subsequent breast cancer.
                Incorporation of longitudinal changes into existing models could
                optimize risk stratification and guide more personalized risk
                management.},

    abstract = {Mammographic features influence breast cancer risk and are used
                in risk prediction models. Understanding how genetics influence
                mammographic features is important because the mechanisms through
                which they are associated with breast cancer are not well known.
                Here, using mammographic screening history and detailed
                questionnaire data from 56,820 women from the KARMA prospective
                cohort study, we investigated the association between a genetic
                predisposition to breast cancer and mammographic features among
                women with a family history of breast cancer (N = 49,674) and a
                polygenic risk score (PRS, N = 9,365). The heritability of
                mammographic features such as dense area (MD),
                microcalcifications, masses, and density change (MDC, cm2/year)
                was estimated using 1,940 sister pairs. Heritability was
                estimated at 58\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 48\%–67\%) for
                MD, 23\% (2\%–45\%) for microcalcifications, and 13\% (1\%–25\%)]
                for masses. The estimated heritability for MDC was essentially
                null (2\%; 95\% CI, −8\% to 12\%). The association between a
                genetic predisposition to breast cancer (using PRS) and MD and
                microcalcifications was positive, while for masses this was
                borderline significant. In addition, for MDC, having a family
                history of breast cancer was associated with slightly greater MD
                reduction. In summary, we have confirmed previous findings of
                heritability in MD, and also established heritability of the
                number of microcalcifications and masses at baseline. Because
                these features are associated with breast cancer risk and can
                improve detecting women at short-term risk of breast cancer,
                further investigation of common loci associated with mammographic
                features is warranted to better understand the etiology of breast
                cancer.These findings provide novel data on the heritability of
                microcalcifications, masses, and density change, which are all
                associated with breast cancer risk and can indicate women at
                short-term risk.},

                factors contributing to its occurrence and exploring advancements
                in diagnostic methodologies. Through an extensive examination of
                current literature, various risk factors have been identified,
                encompassing genetic predispositions such as BRCA mutations,
                hormonal influences, lifestyle factors, and reproductive
                patterns. Age, family history, and environmental factors further
                contribute to the intricate tapestry of breast cancer etiology.
                Moreover, this review delineates the pivotal role of diagnostic
                tools in the early detection and management of breast cancer.
                Mammography, the cornerstone of breast cancer screening, is
                augmented by emerging technologies like magnetic resonance
                imaging and molecular testing, enabling improved sensitivity and
                specificity in diagnosing breast malignancies. Despite these
                advancements, challenges persist in ensuring widespread
                accessibility to screening programs, particularly in
                resource-limited settings. In conclusion, this review underscores
                the importance of understanding diverse risk factors in the
                development of breast cancer and emphasizes the critical role of
                evolving diagnostic modalities in enhancing early detection. The
                synthesis of current knowledge in this review aims to contribute
                to a deeper comprehension of breast cancer’s multifactorial
                nature and inform future directions in research, screening
                strategies, and preventive interventions.},

    abstract = {Aim Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one
                of the most important causes of death among them. This review
                aimed to investigate the incidence and mortality rates of breast
                cancer and to identify the risk factors for breast cancer in the
                world. Materials and methods A search was performed in PubMed,
                Web of Science, and Scopus databases without any time
                restrictions. The search keywords included the following terms:
                breast cancer, risk factors, incidence, and mortality and a
                combination of these terms. Studies published in English that
                referred to various aspects of breast cancer including
                epidemiology and risk factors were included in the study. Overall
                , 142 articles published in English were included in the study.
                Results Based on the published studies, the incidence rate of
                breast cancer varies greatly with race and ethnicity and is
                higher in developed countries. Results of this study show that
                mortality rate of breast cancer is higher in less developed
                regions. The findings of this study demonstrated that various
                risk factors including demographic, reproductive, hormonal,
                hereditary, breast related, and lifestyle contribute to the
                incidence of breast cancer. Conclusion The results of this study
                indicated that incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer is
                rising, so design and implementation of screening programs and
                the control of risk factors seem essential.},

                classification system proposed by the American College of
                Radiology (ACR) in 1986 with the original report released in
                1993. The 1980s saw an exponential increase in mammography with
                the implementation of yearly screening mammograms and
                overwhelming variation amongst radiology reports. BI-RADS~was
                implemented to standardize~risk assessment and quality control
                for mammography and provide uniformity in the reports for~
                non-radiologist. The first version proposed included the
                suggested structure for a mammographic report, the lexicon for
                mammographic imaging findings, and final assessment category with
                recommendations for management. The ACR used scientific analysis
                and literature review to create a lexicon of~descriptors that had
                shown to correlate with~high predictive values associated with
                either benign or malignant disease. The second important aspect
                of the BI-RADS system was the category classification for the
                overall assessment of the imaging findings. The categorization
                provides an approximate risk of malignancy to a lesion from
                essentially zero to greater than 95\%. The categorization and
                final assessment decreased ambiguity in recommendations. BI-RADS
                was built to be fluid and change with the adaptation of new
                techniques and research.~Such changes that have occurred are the~
                inclusion of~lexicons for ultrasound in 2003 and MRI in 2006. The
                latest edition is BI-RADS 5 (2013) and included six
                classifications for lesions.},

                risk of developing breast cancer based on the Breast Imaging
                Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and density standards. Recent
                studies have suggested that the combination of multi-view
                analysis improved the overall breast exam classification. In this
                paper, we propose a novel multi-view DL approach for BI-RADS and
                density assessment of mammograms. The proposed approach first
                deploys deep convolutional networks for feature extraction on
                each view separately. The extracted features are then stacked and
                fed into a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier
                to predict BI-RADS and density scores. We conduct extensive
                experiments on both the internal mammography dataset and the
                public dataset Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM).
                The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
                outperforms the single-view classification approach on two
                benchmark datasets by huge F1-score margins (+5\% on the internal
                dataset and +10\% on the DDSM dataset). These results highlight

    abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have contributed importantly to current
                knowledge of environmental and genetic risk factors for breast
                cancer. Worldwide, breast cancer is an important cause of human
                suffering and premature mortality among women. In the United
                States, breast cancer accounts for more cancer deaths in women
                than any site other than lung cancer. A variety of risk factors
                for breast cancer have been well-established by epidemiologic
                studies including race, ethnicity, family history of cancer, and
                genetic traits, as well as modifiable exposures such as increased
                alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, exogenous hormones, and
                certain female reproductive factors. Younger age at menarche,
                parity, and older age at first full-term pregnancy may influence
                breast cancer risk through long-term effects on sex hormone
                levels or by other biological mechanisms. Recent studies have
                suggested that triple negative breast cancers may have a distinct
                etiology. Genetic variants and mutations in genes that code for
                proteins having a role in DNA repair pathways and the homologous
                recombination of DNA double stranded breaks (APEX1, BRCA1, BRCA2,

                radiologist-like levels in the evaluation of digital mammography
                (DM) would improve breast cancer screening accuracy and
                efficiency. We aimed to compare the stand-alone performance of an
                AI system to that of radiologists in detecting breast cancer in
                DM. Methods Nine multi-reader, multi-case study datasets
                previously used for different research purposes in seven
                countries were collected. Each dataset consisted of DM exams
                acquired with systems from four different vendors, multiple
                radiologists’ assessments per exam, and ground truth verified by
                histopathological analysis or follow-up, yielding a total of 2652
                exams (653 malignant) and interpretations by 101 radiologists (28
                \,296 independent interpretations). An AI system analyzed these
                exams yielding a level of suspicion of cancer present between 1
                and 10. The detection performance between the radiologists and
                the AI system was compared using a noninferiority null hypothesis
                at a margin of 0.05. Results The performance of the AI system was
                statistically noninferior to that of the average of the 101
                radiologists. The AI system had a 0.840 (95\% confidence interval
                [CI] = 0.820 to 0.860) area under the ROC curve and the average
                of the radiologists was 0.814 (95\% CI = 0.787 to 0.841)
                (difference 95\% CI = −0.003 to 0.055). The AI system had an AUC
                higher than 61.4\% of the radiologists. Conclusions The evaluated
                AI system achieved a cancer detection accuracy comparable to an
                average breast radiologist in this retrospective setting.
                Although promising, the performance and impact of such a system
                in a screening setting needs further investigation.},
